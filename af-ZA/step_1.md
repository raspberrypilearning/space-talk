## What you will make

Create a space scene with characters 👾 that 'emote' to share their thoughts or feelings.

In Scratch, characters and objects are called **sprites**, and they appear on the **Stage**.

You will:
+ Add sprites and a **backdrop** to set up your project
+ Click on sprites to make them communicate using `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} and `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} code blocks
+ Use the **Paint editor** to change a **costume**
