The **Tera** sprite's personality is your choice, so have fun using your own creative ideas.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked

say [Hello!] for [2] seconds

say [Hello!]

say [] // hide speech bubble

think [Hmm...] for [2] seconds

switch costume to [tera-d v]

wait (1) seconds // 0.5 is half a second

set [color v] effect to [0] // number up to 200

clear graphic effects

play sound [pop v] until done

start sound [pop v]

speak [hello]
```

You can also 'remix' the project to make any changes you like. You could change the backdrop, and how the sprites emote, and even choose different sprites and give them emotes.
