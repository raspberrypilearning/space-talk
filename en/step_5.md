## Giga changes colour


Sprites can also use thought bubbles and change colours to show their personality.

Add the Giga sprite.

Add this code

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
set [color v] effect to [0] // number up to 200
think [Hmm...] for [2] secs 
clear graphic effects
```

Giga communicates by changing colour. 

Try different numbers in the `set color effect` block until you find a colour you like. You can also change the words and number of seconds in the `think` block.
