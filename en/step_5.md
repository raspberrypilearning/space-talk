## Nano switches costumes

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

You will get Nano to emote by switching **costumes**.

Sprites have **costumes** to change the way that they look. To animate a sprite, you can change its costumes.

Make sure that the **Nano** sprite is selected in the Sprite list below the Stage.

Click on the **Code** tab and add a script to get the **Nano** sprite to `say`{:class="block3looks"} `Thanks!`:

![The Nano sprite.](images/nano-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked // when Nano is clicked
switch costume to [nano-b v] // Nano talking
say [Thanks!] for [2] seconds // try 1 instead of 2
switch costume to [nano-a v] // Nano smiling
```
--- /task ---

**Tip:** All the blocks are colour-coded, so you will find the `switch costume to`{:class="block3looks"} block in the `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} blocks menu.

--- task ---

**Test:** Click on the **Nano** sprite on the Stage and check that the speech bubble appears and Nano's costume changes.

--- /task ---

### Nano uses sign language

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">Millions of people use sign language to communicate. A common sign for 'thank you' is **bringing your right hand up to your mouth**.

Nano will use sign language by switching costumes. 

You can edit costumes for your sprites with the Paint editor. You will edit a costume of Nano to get them to sign "thank you".
