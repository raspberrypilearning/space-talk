## Nano switches costumes

You will get Nano to emote by switching **costumes**.

Sprites have **costumes** to change the way that they look. You can animate a sprite by changing its costumes.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
![The Nano sprite saying "Thanks!"](images/nano-step-2.png){:width="300px"}
</div>
</div>

Add the **Nano** sprite to your project from the **Fantasy** category.

--- task ---

Make sure **Nano** is selected under the Stage. Click on the **Code** tab and add a script to `say`{:class="block3looks"} `Thanks!`:

![The Nano sprite](images/nano-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked // when Nano is clicked
switch costume to [nano-b v] // Nano talking
say [Thanks!] for [2] secs // try 1 instead of 2
switch costume to [nano-a v] // Nano smiles
```
--- /task ---

**Tip:** All the blocks are colour-coded, so you will find the `switch costume to`{:class="block3looks"} block in the `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} blocks menu.

**Test:** Click on the **Nano** sprite on the Stage to see the sprite say "Thanks!".

You can edit costumes for your sprites with the Paint editor. You will edit a costume of Nano to make one with one hand up to their mouth.
