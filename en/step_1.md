## Introduction

You will create a space scene with characters that 'emote' to share their thoughts or feelings.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**emotes**</span> are a way of showing the personality of a character in a game. They can use speech, sounds, movement and graphic effects, just like in Scratch. Do you play any games that use emotes?
</p>

In Scratch, characters and objects are called **sprites** and they appear on the **Stage**. A **backdrop** changes the way the stage looks.

You will:
+ add sprites and a backdrop to set up your project,
+ click sprites to make them communicate using `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} and `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} code blocks,
+ use the **Paint editor** to change a **costume**.

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click on each sprite to see what they do. 

What happens if you click on one sprite and then quickly click on another?
