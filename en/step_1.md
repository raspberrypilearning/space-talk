## Introduction

In this project, you will create a space scene with characters that 'emote' to share their thoughts or feelings.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Emotes**</span> are a way of showing the personality of a character in a game. They can use speech, sounds, movement, and graphic effects, just like in Scratch. Do you play any games that use emotes?
</p>

In Scratch, characters and objects are called **sprites**, and they appear on the **Stage**. 

You will:
+ Add sprites and a **backdrop** to set up your project
+ Click on sprites to make them communicate using `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} and `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} code blocks
+ Use the **Paint editor** to change a **costume**

### Try it

<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click on each sprite to see what they do. 

What happens if you click on one sprite and then quickly click on another sprite?
