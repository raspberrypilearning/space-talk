## Introduction

You will create sprites that ‘emote’ to share their thoughts or feelings. 

A **sprite** is a character or object in a Scratch project. A sprite can have code, costumes and sounds to change the way it looks and what it does. 

You will:
+ add sprites and a **backdrop** to set up your project,
+ make the sprites communicate using `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} and `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} code blocks,
+ use the **Paint editor** to change a **costume**.

‘emotes’ are a way of showing the personality of a character in a game. They can use speech, sounds, movement and graphic effects, just like in Scratch. Do you play any games that use emotes?
