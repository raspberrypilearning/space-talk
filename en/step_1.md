## Introduction

A **sprite** is a character or object in a Scratch project. A sprite can have code, costumes and sounds to change the way it looks and what it does. You will create sprites that ‘emote’ to share their thoughts or feelings.

You will:
+ add sprites and a **backdrop** to set up your project,
+ make the sprites communicate using `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} and `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} blocks,
+ use the **Paint editor** to change a **costume**.

‘emotes’ are a way of showing the personality of a character in a game. They can use speech, sounds, movement and graphic effects, just like in Scratch. Do you play any games that use emotes?
