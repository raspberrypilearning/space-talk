## Introduction

You will create sprites that ‘emote’ to share their thoughts or feelings. 

A **sprite** is a character or object in a Scratch project. A sprite can have code, costumes and sounds to change the way it looks and what it does. 

You will:
+ add sprites and a **backdrop** to set up your project,
+ make the sprites communicate using `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} and `Sound`{:class="block3sound"} code blocks,
+ use the **Paint editor** to change a **costume**.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click on each sprite to see what they do. 

What happens if you click on one sprite and then quickly click on another?

‘emotes’ are a way of showing the personality of a character in a game. They can use speech, sounds, movement and graphic effects, just like in Scratch. Do you play any games that use emotes?
