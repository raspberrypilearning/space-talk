## Introduction

A *sprite* is a character or object in a Scratch project. A sprite can have code, costumes and sounds to change the way it looks and what it does. You will create sprites that ‘emote’ to communicate and share their feelings. 

You will add sprites and a *backdrop* to set up your project. Then you will make the sprites communicate using `Looks` and `Sound` and changing the *costume* of a sprite using the *Paint editor*. You will design and code the ‘emote’ for at least one sprite.

‘emotes’ are a way of showing the personality of a character in a game. They can use speech, sounds, movement and graphic effects, just like in Scratch. Do you play any games that use emotes?
