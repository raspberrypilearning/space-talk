```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
switch costume to [nano-a2 v] // hand to mouth
say [Thanks!] for [2] secs // try 1 instead 
switch costume to [nano-a v] // smiling
```

*Tip*: All the blocks are colour coded so you will find the `change costume to` block in the `Looks` blocks menu.

[Over 100,000 people use the language 'Makaton' to communicate using signs and symbols. You have just coded Nano to use the Makaton sign for 'thank you.' Next time you say thank you to someone why not use your new skill to say it in Makaton.]
