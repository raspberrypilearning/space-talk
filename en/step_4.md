Go back to the **Code** tab and drag a `switch costume to`{:class="block3looks"} block to the Code area. 

Try changing the selected costume by clicking on **nano-a** and choosing another costume from the menu. Click on the block to see Nano's costume change on the stage:

You can also change costumes with the Paint editor. You are going to make a costume with one hand up to Nanoâ€™s mouth. 

Click on the **Costumes** tab then right-click on the **nano-a** costume and choose 'duplicate'. You will now have a **nano-a2** costume.

--- task ---
Now switch to the **Code** tab and change your code to make the **Nano** sprite `say`{:class="block3looks"} 'Thanks!':

![image of the Nano sprite](images/nano-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
switch costume to [nano-a2 v] // hand to mouth
say [Thanks!] for [2] secs // try 1 instead 
switch costume to [nano-a v] // smiling
```
--- /task ---

*Tip*: All the blocks are colour coded so you will find the `change costume to`{:class="block3looks"} block in the `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} Blocks menu.

**Boxout** 
Over 100,000 people use the language 'Makaton' to communicate using signs and symbols. You have just coded the **Nano** sprite to use the Makaton sign for 'thank you.' Next time you say thank you to someone why not use your new skill to say it in Makaton.
