If you are following the [Scratch 1 pathway](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/scratch-intro) pathway, you can move on to the [Scratch tour bus](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/scratch-tour-bus) project. In this project, you will code an animation with sprites that need to make it to a bus before it leaves.
