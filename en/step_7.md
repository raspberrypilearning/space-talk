## Upgrade your project

Add the Tera sprite and use any of the blocks you have learned about to make an 'emote' for Tera.
Tera's personality is your choice, so have fun using your own creative ideas.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked

say [Hello!] for [2] secs

say [Hello!]

say [] // hide speech bubble

think [Hmm...] for [2] secs

switch costume to [tera-d v]

set [color v] effect to [0] // number up to 200

clear graphic effects

play sound [pop v] until done

start sound [pop v]
```

You can also 'remix' the project to make any changes you like. You could change the backdrop, how the sprites emote and even choose different sprites and give them emotes.

**Tip:** Click on a sprite in the Sprite list under the Stage to change the code, costumes and sound for that sprite.
