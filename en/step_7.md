## Remix

Add the Tera sprite and use any of the blocks you have learned about to make an 'emote' for Tera. 

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked

say [Hello!] for [2] secs

say [Hello!]

say []

think [Hmm...] for [2] secs

switch costume to [tera-d v]

set [color v] effect to [0]

clear graphic effects

play sound [pop v] until done

```

Tera's personality is your choice, there's no correct answer.
